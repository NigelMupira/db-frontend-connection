# Database for this project

* I don't exactly know how to upload a database onto GitHub,
* I instead uploaded the sql queries i used to create the database

### What to do?
So to connect to the database for implementation, you would need to:

1. Install MS SQL SERVER and SSMS
2. Execute these queries to create the database
3. Go to your IDE (e.g. Visual Studio) and run the program
